## Process

Follow these steps in exact order. Do NOT skip ahead. Steps 1–3 are run directly by the orchestrator via Bash/tool calls.

### Step 1: Preflight

Run these checks before doing anything else.

**Branch check:**
- Get current branch: `git branch --show-current`
- STOP immediately if branch is `main`, `master`, or `develop`. Tell the user: "Cannot ship from a protected branch. Switch to a feature branch first."

**Commits ahead check:**
- Run `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline`. If `origin/main` does not exist, try `origin/master`.
- STOP if no commits are ahead. Tell the user: "No commits ahead of base branch — nothing to ship."

**Uncommitted changes check:**
- Run `git status --porcelain`.
- If output is non-empty: show advisory warning — "Uncommitted changes detected — these may belong to another branch." Do NOT fail.

**Task status check:**
- Run `TaskList`.
- If incomplete tasks exist (status `pending` or `in_progress`): show advisory warning — "Incomplete tasks remain." Do NOT fail.

### Step 2: Push

Push the current branch to the remote.

- Check if branch tracks a remote: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream}`
- If tracking exists: `git push`
- If no tracking (command fails): `git push -u origin $(git branch --show-current)`

### Step 3: Create or update PR

Check if a PR already exists for this branch.

- Run `gh pr view --json url`
- **If PR exists:** report the URL and skip creation.
- **If no PR exists:** create one via `gh pr create`.

**PR title — Conventional Commits format:**
Derive from the branch name. Transform hyphens to spaces, extract scope from ticket references.
- `feat/PROJ-123-add-dark-mode` → `feat(PROJ-123): add dark mode`
- `fix/login-session-expiry` → `fix: login session expiry`
- `chore/update-dependencies` → `chore: update dependencies`
- If the branch name does not clearly indicate a type, default to `feat`.

**PR body — structured format:**
```
## Summary
<Brief description derived from commit messages and task descriptions>

## Changes
<List of key changes from: git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline>

## Test Plan
<Derived from task acceptance criteria if available, otherwise "Manual verification">
```

Use a HEREDOC to pass the body to `gh pr create` for correct formatting.

### Step 4: Self-review

This step is mandatory. NEVER skip it.

- Invoke the built-in `/review-pr` skill via the `Skill` tool: `skill: "review-pr"`
- The review findings are returned directly in the conversation — they are NOT posted to GitHub.
- Parse the returned findings into structured items. Each item MUST have:
  - **file** — the file path
  - **line** — the line number (or range)
  - **description** — what the finding is

### Step 5: Triage findings

If no findings from the review, skip to Step 6 with "no findings".

**Classify each finding into one of three severity tiers:**

- **Must Address** — bugs, security issues, logic errors, data loss risks
- **Should Consider** — code quality, performance, maintainability concerns
- **Nitpick** — style, naming preferences, minor readability

**Present findings as a numbered list grouped by category:**

```
### Must Address
1. [file:line] Description

### Should Consider
2. [file:line] Description

### Nitpick
3. [file:line] Description
```

Ask the user which findings to address. Tell them they can pick numbers (e.g., "1, 3"), "all", or "none".

### Step 6: Next steps

Based on user selection:

- **Findings selected (non-trivial — multi-file or architectural):**
  Summarise the selected findings as a brief. Tell the user:
  "Run `/orc:plan` to plan the changes, then `/orc:tasks` → `/orc:execute` → `/orc:ship`."

- **Findings selected (trivial — single-file, obvious fix):**
  Summarise the selected findings. Tell the user:
  "Run `/orc:execute <description>` to address directly, then `/orc:ship`."

- **No findings or "none" selected:**
  "PR is ready for human review." Report the PR URL.

## Rules

- NEVER ship from a protected branch (`main`/`master`/`develop`) — Step 1 MUST stop
- NEVER force push (`--force` or `--force-with-lease`) — always plain `git push`
- NEVER skip self-review — Step 4 is mandatory every time, no exceptions
- NEVER post review findings to GitHub — findings stay in the conversation only
- NEVER create tasks directly from review findings — route through `/orc:plan` or `/orc:execute <description>`
- Uncommitted changes are advisory only — they may belong to another branch. Do NOT fail on them.
- Incomplete tasks are advisory only — do NOT fail on them
